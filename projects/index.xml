If you missed the first part, you can find it here.
At the end of part 1 we generated a set of names and had a quick peek at those names. In this part we are going to dive deeper into the topic of data quality, how to define it, how to measure it and how to use it to tune our model.</description></item><item><title>Transformer based Name Generator - Part 1</title><link>https://www.manuelpasieka.com/projects/transformer_based_name_generator_part1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.manuelpasieka.com/projects/transformer_based_name_generator_part1/</guid><description>This is the first of a three part blog post series in which we are going to develop a Transformer based name generator
Exploring the model and generating the first names Evaluate the quality of the generated names Perform hyper parameter tuning to better understand the model architecture and improve data quality Overview and Introduction In this blog post series you will learn how to build a pytorch model that learns to generate new names from a list of examples.</description></item><item><title>Deploying a Machine Learning development environment in less than 5 minutes</title><link>https://www.manuelpasieka.com/projects/ml_dev_deployment_on_aws/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.manuelpasieka.com/projects/ml_dev_deployment_on_aws/</guid><description>In this blog post, you are going to learn, how to deploy an AWS instance with a python Machine Learning development environment using Terraform. So you will be able to deploy your next cloud based Machine Learning environment in less than 5 minutes.
This post is most useful for people that have at least a basic understanding of the applied technologies (AWS, Terraform, Unix), so they can adapt the provided template for their own projects.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://www.manuelpasieka.com/projects/templates/first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 22:41:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.manuelpasieka.com/projects/templates/first-post/</guid><description>This is my first post!
