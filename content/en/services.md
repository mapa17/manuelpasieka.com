## Training & Workshops
Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful technology that can help you accelerate your
business with new services and products if you know how to apply it correctly.

I can provide you with training and workshops ranging from the business
perspective to specific technologies in machine learning.

## Feasibility Study
The applications of ML to improve business are huge, but how do you apply them
to your company and your specific product? How do you know which projects are
feasible with a reasonable amount of afford and which would require years of
research?

I will provide you with the information you need to make the right decision  on
which projects to implement by performing a **feasibility study** of your ideas
and concepts that will highlight the biggest challenges
that you need to overcome and what skills and resources you will require to succeed.

## Machine Learning & Software Engineering
It's challenging to find machine learning engineers that can understand business
objectives and product design while at the same time having solid software
engineering skills to develop data products using state of the art machine
learning frameworks, and the cloud infrastructure understanding to bring models
into production at scale.

I can support you in developing your product covering the full ML tech stack.
Applying my expertise to help you with system architecture, a transition to a
modern technology stack and developer training and hiring.
