Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful technology that can help you accelerate your
business with new services and products if you know how to apply it correctly.

I can provide you with training and workshops ranging from the business
perspective to specific technologies in machine learning.

## Feasibility Study
The applications of ML to improve business are huge, but how do you apply them
to your company and your specific product? How do you know which projects are
feasible with a reasonable amount of afford and which would require years of
research?

I will provide you with the information you need to make the right decision  on
which projects to implement by performing a **feasibility study** of your ideas
and concepts that will highlight the biggest challenges
that you need to overcome and what skills and resources you will require to succeed.
